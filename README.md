## install python
We've tested with Python 3.13.7

python is needed by our tiny little `startHTTP.sh` or `startHTTP.bat` webserver, which is needed to view this demo.

On MacOSX:
```
brew install python
```

## running the demo in your browser
In your terminal:

On MacOSX:
```
./startHTTP.sh
open http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

On Windows:
```
./startHTTP.bat
start http://0.0.0.0:8000
```
